# Application Continuity for Planned Maintenance

## Introduction

In this lab we will create a connection pool with 10 connections and verify that Oracle distributes them equally between the cluster nodes.


**Estimated Time: 30 minutes.**

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Verify that the UCP connection pool balances the connections
* Move datbase services from a clu

### Prerequisites

* The Oracle environment prepared in lab 1.


## Task 1: Configure the lab

1. Configure the pool for 10 connections
2. Recompile the application


## Task 2: Connection loda balancing

1. Start demo with TAC service
2. Observe Connection load balancing


## Task 3: Planned maintenance

1. Move the service to a different RAC instance
2. Show this is transparent to the program


**You can proceed to the next lab…**
