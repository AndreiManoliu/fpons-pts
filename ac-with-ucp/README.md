# Application Continuity made simple with Universal Connection Pool

**Application Continuity** makes planned maintenance activities and unplanned outages transparent for end-users by recovering the in-flight work of impacted database sessions.

Run this hands-on workshop to learn how to use RAC services, configure Fast Application Notification, Draining and Application Continuity from Oracle connection pools (UCP). UCP provides explicit request boundaries on check-out and check-in of connections, which makes AC easy to use.
