# Application Continuity made simple with Universal Conncection Pool

![Intro Application Continuity made simple with Universal Conncection Pool](./images/intro.png)

## Introduction

This workshop has three parts:

- Environment Configuration
- Simple Application Continuity in Action
- Using Application Continuity for Planned Maintenance


**Estimated Workshop Time: 90 minutes.**

## Objectives

This workshop is based on a compute instance running a 21c client connected to a 2-node DBCS RAC.
The 21c client is a compute instance hosting a simple Java program. Its code shows how to create a Universal Connection Pool to the RAC.
It demonstrates:
*	How to set up UCP (good for ISVs);
*	How to set up ONS & FAN (required for Application Continuity and Transparent Application Continuity );
*	How to configure and use database services to make planned maintenance as well as other outages transparent to applications.

The demo program allows to interrupt a transaction at will and show whether or not it is transparently replayed on a different node of the RAC.
